When creating a user from the manager view the pass word is set to '1234' as a default so that when you give the account to the user they can change their password without the manager account knowing what it is (Thanks to bcrypt). The program Urges you to change your password from default every time you log in with the default password.

My User Report is not working the way I want yet, and Deleteing things from the databse is not yet possible. another thing I want to work on is reading the CSV file and making updates to the database based on the imported csv. While these options are accessible within the menu, it displays a message saying the option is not yet avalible and kicks you back to the menu you were origianaly at. 12/10/2021 is the date of my first commit and will be looking to commit more in the future.
